# Lab1

I've created a program that will create a Binary Search Tree. The available commands are Insert, which tells us to create the Binary Search Tree. The next command is Search, to search for a input element in the BST, Delete, to delete a element from the BST, Inorder, to traversate the tree in an inorder manner.

Postorder, to traverse the tree in a postorder manner and Preorder, to traverse the tree in a preorder manner.
